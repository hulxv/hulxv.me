# Introduction
In recent years, we have seen multiple jumps in the cryptocurrency and blockchain world. A few months ago, Bitcoin was the 5th most valuable asset in the world when it hit $122,000. Investment in this field is very high with many opportunities for developers and low competition. It's time to take your first step as a Bitcoin/blockchain developer!

As students (in 3rd world countries specifically), we spent a lot of time to find an internship or a job but the result at the end is nothing. A lot of changes happend last 5 years. It's not easy to find a chance to get experience and paid. the market in the worldwide is decreased a lot. But at the end of the dark, you will find the light! there are a lot opportunities you may heard about and may not. From this opportunities, the most famous program about open-source, Google Summer of Code. A lot of people know it but few know that there's a lot of programs like it can gain experience and well paid also!

Among these programs, there's a program we're going to discuss, Summer of Bitcoin!

# So, What is this Program?
> [Summer of Bitcoin Guide](https://guide.summerofbitcoin.org/about/what-is-summer-of-bitcoin): Summer of Bitcoin is a global, online summer internship program focused on introducing university students to bitcoin open-source development and design. Students spend 12 weeks during the summer contributing to an open-source project, earn bitcoin as stipend and put their summer break to good use.

This is a brief description from the Summer of Bitcoin Guide. If you know Google Summer of Code, you will understand it clearly, but if you don't, it's simply an internship to work on real-world open source projects but for the blockchain and Bitcoin world. There are many technologies like helpful libraries, protocols, wallets, etc. that are developed to enhance the blockchain community and make Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies easy-to-use with better privacy and lots of features.

> If you don't know about Google Summer of Code, I suggest you read this article: [Why Google Summer of Code is a golden Opportunity](https://xuser5000.hashnode.dev/why-google-summer-of-code-is-a-golden-opportunity). I inspired the title from it :)

Bitcoin is an open-source project started with a research paper by someone is anonymous man called Satoshi Nakamoto on Oct 2008 to create an electronic cash system. Here's we see the power of open-source, no one can control it, no one can stop it, and no one can change it. It's a decentralized system that is run by the users. The code is open for everyone to see and contribute to it. From this idea, a lot of projects are created to enhance the bitcoin and blockchain world and the Summer of bitcoin program continues this thing!

# Why it is Valuable More Than Gold?
From my experience in the program, I can say that it's very valuable for students and developers. You will gain a lot of experience in the blockchain world and bitcoin specifically. You will work on real-world projects that are used by thousands of people. You will learn a lot of new technologies and tools that are used in the blockchain world. You will also get paid in bitcoin, which is a great opportunity to start your journey in the cryptocurrency world. The amount of the stipend is based on your country. This is a great opportunity to earn some money while learning and gaining experience.

In addition to the experience and money, you will also get a chance to network with industry professionals and other students from around the world. Also, they will provide you with many opportunities and grants while giving you a referral to get a full-time job in blockchain companies. They wouldn't let you down after finishing the program. They want you to continue your journey in the blockchain world and help you find a job in it and you will find a lot of opportunities after finishing the program!

They will also send you a cool hardware wallet called Jade to store your Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is a great opportunity to get a hardware wallet for free because the price of it is around $100.

I feel I am a salesman for the program xD but seriously, I am very happy that I joined it and I am very thankful for the mentors and org admins for their help and support. I learned a lot of new things and I am still learning. If you are a student, I highly recommend you to apply for this program. It's valuable more than gold!


# How it Works?
If you joined Google Summer of Code before, you will find similarities between them, but there are some differences also. The program is for students only and you must be a student (high school, college, or university).

The program offers **two main tracks** depending on your skills and interests:

**Developer Track:** This is for students who love coding and want to build technical solutions. You'll work on things like Bitcoin libraries, protocol implementations, wallet backends, Lightning Network tools, or mining software. If you're comfortable with programming languages like Rust, C++, Python, or JavaScript, this track is perfect for you.

**Design Track:** This is for students who are passionate about user experience and visual design. You'll work on making Bitcoin and blockchain technology more accessible through better interfaces, user research, wireframes, prototypes, and visual designs. If you love Figma, user research, or creating beautiful interfaces, this track is your path.

Both tracks are equally important because Bitcoin needs both powerful technology and great user experiences to reach mainstream adoption. Whether you're a coder or a designer, there's a place for you in the Bitcoin ecosystem!

There are 3 main phases in the program: Application Form, Bootcamp, and Proposal Round. We will discuss each phase in detail.

## Application Form Phase
This phase is the first phase in the program and very simple. You need to fill a form with your details and submit it. The form is available on the [Summer of Bitcoin website](https://summerofbitcoin.org/). The form is very simple and you need to provide your name, email, country, and a link to your GitHub profile. They will review your application and if you are selected (and mostly you will be), you will receive an email with the next steps.

> Note: Check your spam folder if you didn't receive any email from them after a few days and your university email because you will submit it and sometimes they send the mail to it instead of your main email.

## Bootcamp
This phase is the second phase in the program and it's a learning phase. You will learn about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. They will provide you with a lot of resources to learn from. This phase is very important because it will help you understand the basics of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. This phase will take about <u>**4 weeks**</u>, and you receive an assignment each week to complete it. You will need to pass each assignment before the week ends, <u>**or you will be out of the program**</u>.

## Proposal Round
Congrats for passing the Bootcamp and finishing your assignments! Now, the real work has started. This phase is very similar to what happens in Google Summer of Code. You will find a list of organizations and each organization has some projects. You can choose up to 3 projects you like to work on and after that you will need to write a proposal that explains all details about completing this project and implementing it. After that, your proposal will be reviewed by org admins and mentors. This is the last phase in the process. If your proposal is good enough for mentors you will be accepted and start working on your project with help from your mentors.

# How to Pass the Proposal Round?
The proposal round is the most important phase in the process. It depends on it whether you will be accepted or not and needs a lot of work. I will provide you some advice to pass it.

## Try to Understand the Project Well!
If you read the project description for the first time you may not understand it well. That's normal, don't worry about that. You need to search about it and use tools like Google or LLMs and I suggest LLMs because you can ask anything you don't understand and they will explain it in detail and it will be helpful if you add statements like "Hey Chat! I am a kid with 6 years old. explain this project to me!!!". With some effort and searching well, you will have the main picture in your mind about the project and step by step you will fully understand it.

## Make it clear and Straghtforward
Don't yapping a lot in your proposal and about your idea directly without adding unnecessary details. Most of people make LLMs generate a proposal for them and they just copy-paste it. This is not a good idea because the proposal will be generic and not specific to the project. You need to make it clear and straightforward. you can use LLMs to help you in writing but don't rely on them fully.

## Prove that You Can Do it and Understand Well!
This is the most important thing in your proposal. You need to prove that you can do it! You can do it by providing links to your previous work, GitHub profile, or any other thing that can prove that you are a good developer and can complete the project. Also it will be helpful if you can make a small demo if that's possible for your project. Small demos will prove that you understand the project very well and you already did something similar to it. In addition to that, using code snippets and diagrams to explain your plan and implementation idea will be very helpful for that!

## Communicate and Contribute!
Communication between humans is a magic thing. We are all regular people, not machines or anything else without emotions. If I am a mentor and I know you very well and I find you are very active in the org like participating in our discussions and let us get to know more about you, I will choose you by 100%!

By doing some contributions, you will prove that you are a good developer with good skills. So, this will play an important role to be accepted in the program.

# After Acceptance
> Hi, Mohamed,  
> We're excited to share that you have been accepted to Summer of Bitcoin 2025 for the project "Event Loop Library for Efficient I/O Management."...

Congratulations! This is the moment you've been waiting for. When I got this email, I couldn't believe it at first. After all the hard work during the application process, you're finally in!

Don't worry about what comes next. you've already proven yourself by getting this far. You have 12 weeks to complete your project, which might sound scary, but it's actually plenty of time. I remember being worried about my semester exams too, but here's the thing: your mentors get it. Most of them were students once, and they know how stressful exam periods can be. Just talk to them early about your schedule. they're understanding and will work with you.

You will face some challenges during the program, but don't worry, that's normal. Just keep pushing forward and don't give up. You got this!

# How to Prepare for the Next Year?
If you're thinking about applying next year, let me share some practical advice based on what I've learned from the program and what I've seen work for other successful applicants.

**Start with Bitcoin basics, but don't overthink it.** I remember feeling overwhelmed when I first read about blockchain technology. There's so much information out there! But here's what worked for me: I started with the basics and built up from there. You don't need to become a Bitcoin expert overnight. Just understanding how transactions work, what mining is, and why decentralization matters is a great start.

**Get comfortable with Git and GitHub.** This one is huge. I can't tell you how many times I've seen brilliant students struggle during the program because they weren't comfortable with version control. Start contributing to any open-source project. it doesn't even have to be Bitcoin-related at first. The important thing is learning how to fork repositories, make pull requests, and work with others' code.

**Practice your craft, but stay curious.** Whether you're going for the Developer or Design track, don't just focus on technical skills. What really impressed my mentors was that I showed genuine curiosity about the problems we were solving. If you're a developer, try building a simple Bitcoin wallet or transaction parser. If you're a designer, think about why most crypto wallets are confusing and sketch some better solutions.

**Start contributing early, but start small.** Look for "good first issue" labels on GitHub, fix documentation, or help with translations. The goal isn't to make huge changes. it's to show you're part of the community and understand how open-source collaboration works.

**Join the conversations.** This is where the magic happens. Join the Summer of Bitcoin Discord and several Bitcoin developer channels. Don't just lurk. ask questions, share what you're learning, help others when you can. Community engagement is really valuable, and mentors notice active community members.

Pro tip from my experience: Set up Google Alerts for "Summer of Bitcoin applications" so you know the moment applications open. Don't miss the deadline like many students do each year!

The best advice I can give you? Start now, stay consistent, and don't be afraid to ask stupid questions. The Bitcoin community is surprisingly welcoming to newcomers who show genuine interest in learning.

# Conclusion
Summer of Bitcoin is a great opportunity for students and developers to gain experience in the blockchain world and bitcoin specifically. You will work on real-world projects, learn new technologies, and get paid in bitcoin. You will also get a chance to network with industry professionals and other students from around the world. If you are interested in blockchain and bitcoin, I highly recommend you to apply for this program. It's valuable more than gold!
